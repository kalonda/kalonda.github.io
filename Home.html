	<h2> QUOTES OF LIFE</h2>

<h3>WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h3> 
 Life is inherently<span class="important"> risky</span>. There is only one big risk you should avoid at all costs, and that is the risk of doing nothing.
 <p>
<br>A business <em>opportunity</em> involves sale or lease of any product, service, equipment, etc. that will enable the purchaser-licensee to begin a business.<br> The licensor or seller of a business <em>opportunity</em> usually declares that it will secure or assist the buyer in finding a suitable location or provide the product to the purchaser-licensee. <br>This is different from the sale of an independent business, in which there is no continued relationship required by the seller.</p>

            <h2>WEB PAGE</h2>
I am doing my practice of <pre>web design in html</pre>, so after finishing this, I will make my own pretty website for students of primary school specially standard six.
<img src="students.jpg"title="Nyarugusu aloud day"alt="Nyarugusu aloud day" width="500" height="400"><br>It was a day where students celebrated the book readers day, and they made short stories to show how they improve in reading books.<br>Using the electronic books and other physical books, students enjoy reading those books for improving their language(French and English)</img>
<img src="me.jpg"title="my picture"alt="my picture" width="500" height="400"><br>Students are studying by themselves using tablets connected to the network,<br>
others are using those tablets in hand to communicate with people outside the camp</img>
